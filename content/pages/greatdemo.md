#what is a great demo

1. Demo begins with most compelling screen or screens. Done in 2 minutes or less and audience asks ' How'd you do that?'
2. Once they know solution exists, walk through how you got there with minimal commentary - less than 4 minutes
3. Audience should be asking for more detail - they will guide you to present on what they need. 20-30 minutes

The demo is like a newspaper article - grab with headline, do some summary and leave the bits for the really interested

#why demos fail

1. tech issues
2. bad content or organization
3. failure to qualify or understand customers needs


#what happens if demo fails
1. direct costs + indirect costs + customer costs + future customer business


#your customer
1. Target your audience - critical business issues, reasons for issues, specific capabilities they need to see
2  Go back up the chain of pain to attach capabilities to larger CBIs

#handling questions
 Great, good, and stupid questions
1. Great questions support demo and should be answered right away
2. Good questions are in the parking lot a long with stupid questions

parking lot - acknoqlege the question, confirm it, confirm its ok to answer later, answer it later

tell folks they can stay or leave to see parking lot questions answered...
