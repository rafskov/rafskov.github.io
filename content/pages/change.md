#radical change the quiet way, meyerson

Become a tempered radical

1. Tempered radicals create change slowly and quietly
2. They embody contrasts - firm goals / flexible means, want rapid change but are patient, start conversations

They use disruptive self expression, verbal JJ, variable term opportunis, amd alliance building

self expression - demonstrated through language, dress, or behavior that people talk about
verbal JJ - redirect negative statements or actions in to positive change
variable term - use the short term opps not just pursuing the long term changes
alliances - dont make opponents, gain clout by working with allies

#tipping point leadership - kim and mauborgne

addiction to status quo, limited resources, demotivated employees, and vested interests stop change

1. Make unarguable calls for change
       Make managers experience your organizations problems
2. Concentrate resources on what matters
       Dont ask for more or trim existing resources - focus current resources on areas most needing change
3. mobilize key players
       People with multiple connections ...people who share common concerns
       Make goals attainable
4. silence naysayers
       Use a top respected pro on your team
       Use indisputable facts

#survival for leaders

Leaders are always under fire

1. Observe what's happening to your iniative as its happening
2. Court the uncommitted and fire those who cant make changes
3. Cook the conflict - raise temp to make people confront conflicts but lower when needed. Use humor, breaks and imagery of the future
4. Place the work on others to solve conflicts
5. Restrain your desire for control/importance, dont take attacks personal and use a confidant in you not your initiative
